# Waste

Waste is an in progress mod having everything to do with garbage and how there are ways to transform almost any waste into something valuable. Find abandoned landfills and piles of garbage left over from a past civilization and sort through it to find treasure. I have many plans for this mod, but for now, here are the main things you can do: 

* Mine waste blocks found in the world.
* Sort through the waste in a waste sorting bench you can craft in the crafting tab of a workbench
* Process the treasure you find in a furnace or a salvager to get metals and fibers.

Currently the prefab waste piles don't spawn in the world and require a few extra steps. I will add instructions for how to get everything working by using Pretty Fabulous World shortly.

This mod relies on [Unified Materials](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/unified-materials), which allows you to extract new elements from waste beyond the vanilla metals.
