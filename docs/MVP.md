## Biome Specifications

### Garbage Patch
- create plastic block with 1 texture
- make the texture colors randomized
- place trash blocks together in mounds 
- generate plastic mounds above the water in biome
- plastic leech ocean mob

### General Underground
- change textures for waste, dense waste, compacted waste, ultra compacted waste, solid waste
- make underground liquid's like sewage or water that seeps through the garbage making like tea
- remove ores 
- make the layers more clean lines
- toxic waste lakes underground
- lava lakes underground still
- deep underground there is a sludge layer which is thicker than lava

### General Surface
- make surface layers no dirt just garbage
- add dirty water lakes
- biomes are spread apart. center is dump. 
- 1000 blocks out starts generating garbage patch.
- 2000 blocks out starts generating trash mountain 
- 3000 blocks out starts generating abandoned city
- 5000 blocks out starts generating industrial waste

### Industrial Waste
- toxic waste lakes
- 1 factory structure per biome
- factory has stuff about the cryogenic stasis chambers and paintings of the bunker
- toxic to enter biome without correct gear (basic gas mask)
- metal waste like iron can from ecofriendly on the ground inside the factory

## Garbage Dump
- flat terrain with surface block of dense waste
- huge mounds of waste as configured feature
- add dynamic textures for all types of waste
- rivers will spawn full of dirty water, lakes of dirty water spawn
- random garbage items like ecofriendly iron cans all around biome
- waste crawler big bug mob
- stepping on garbage blocks does small amount of damage unless wearing some type of boots

## Trash Mountain
- flat no elevation dense waste
- towers 5x5x200 block high of ultra_compacted_waste
- try different styles for the towers to see what looks the best
- create custom chest block that is like cache or time capsule and you can find them in the towers
- deactivated compactor beast mob. when activated will help you clean up trash


## Abandoned City
- Rubble Zombie
- lost city fills biome
- skyscraper 23 floors tall
- monocrome block palette
- dense city, 3 block wide streets
- custom chest block in cities with custom loot tables
- full of configurable mob spawns, default to zombies
